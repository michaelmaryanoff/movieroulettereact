# Movie Roulette 

---

Movie Roulette is a great tool to use when you can't figure out which movie to watch. Using a simple interface, you can enter parameters for a movie you'd like to see and "Spin" the movie roulette wheel. I have definitely found some hidden gems (along with hidden not-so-gems) while creating this app.

Movie Roulette supports authentication using the TMDb API.

Movie roulette was built with [React](https://reactjs.org/) and is powered by [The Movie Database](https://www.themoviedb.org/) API.
